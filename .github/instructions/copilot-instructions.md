# AI Instructions

This project is governed by an AI Constitution.

Primary authority:
- Before generating or modifying code, read and follow AI_CONSTITUTION.txt.

Scope:
- The Constitution applies to any request that edits code, configuration,
  database behavior, or runtime logic.
- For non-code tasks (documentation, prompt authoring), the Constitution
  is inert unless explicitly invoked.

Hierarchy:
1. AI_CONSTITUTION.txt
2. User task prompt
3. Project documentation

Do not infer or invent additional rules.
