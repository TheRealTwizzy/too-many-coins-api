The system must actively prevent and mitigate abuse and coordinated manipulation.

Access controls:

Only one active player per IP address per season is the default baseline.

Additional accounts from the same IP are not hard-blocked; they are throttled through economic dampening, cooldowns, and trust-based enforcement.

No whitelist or allowlist is used in alpha.

Account protections:

Account creation is rate-limited.

CAPTCHA and verification are required.

New accounts must wait a short cooldown period before joining a season.

Throttles:

Per-player star purchase rate limits exist.

Per-IP star purchase limits exist, especially early in the season.

Coin earning and star buying may be dynamically throttled for suspicious activity.
Brokered trading eligibility may be tightened or suspended for suspicious activity.

Detection:

The system monitors for clustering patterns such as many new accounts from related IP ranges acting similarly.

Suspicious activity generates abuse events.

Abuse events may trigger automatic temporary throttles.

Trade-specific detection:

Repeated reciprocal trades between the same accounts

Trading patterns that concentrate Stars across related IP ranges

Unusual trade volume spikes relative to participation

Enforcement:

Throttles are gradual and reversible.

The goal is to make abuse economically ineffective, not to punish publicly.

All abuse decisions and throttles are enforced server-side.
