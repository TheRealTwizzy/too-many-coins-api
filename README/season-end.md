# TIME-2 Season End

At the end of a season, the economy is frozen and final standings are recorded.

End-of-season resolution:

Star purchases and coin earning are disabled once the season ends.
Brokered trading is disabled once the season ends; any pending offers are canceled safely.

## Star Conversion — Permanent Profile Statistic

At season end, Stars convert into a **permanent profile statistic**.

**Stars do NOT carry over as a currency.**

**After season end**:

- Stars are converted into a permanent, non-spendable statistic
- The statistic reflects seasonal performance and competitive achievement
- Stars are NOT tradable (before or after conversion)
- Stars are NOT spendable (except via Star Sacrifice for TSAs during the season)
- Stars influence **long-term profile rank and identity**

**Star value scales with season population**:

- Stars earned in larger, more competitive seasons carry more weight
- The conversion reflects the difficulty and competitiveness of the season
- This prevents early-season or low-population inflation of permanent stats

**Stars are the permanent score of seasonal performance**, not a currency that carries forward.

TSA note (post‑alpha/Beta‑only):

All TSA holdings and any pending TSA trades are wiped at season end. TSAs never carry over between seasons.

Final star balances determine leaderboard rankings; TSAs only affect rankings indirectly through their utility.

Rankings are snapshotted and stored permanently.

Rewards (post‑alpha):

Players earn persistent rewards based on season participation and performance.

Rewards are cosmetic or status-based only and do not grant economic advantage.

Rewards may include a persistent meta currency (post‑alpha) for cosmetic / identity use only; it cannot be traded, cannot convert into Coins or Stars, and cannot affect competitive power.

Optional influence / reputation (post‑release) is non‑spendable, eligibility/visibility‑only, and never convertible.

No currency may ever convert into Coins or Stars, directly or indirectly.

Reward types include:

Season badges for participation

Titles for leaderboard tiers

Endgame achievement badges

Profile history entries showing season rank and stats

Late-season recognition (post‑alpha):

Players who participate during the final week earn additional recognition.

Completing late-season challenges grants exclusive cosmetic rewards.

Season closure (post‑alpha):

A summary screen shows final rank, earned rewards, and season highlights.

Players are encouraged to join another active season or the next upcoming season.

All rewards are granted automatically and recorded server-side (post‑alpha).
